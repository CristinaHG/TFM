% the abstract

The present master's final project develop a software package with multiple algorithms for efficiently preprocessing and classifying data with specific intrinsic restrictions due to its nature, as ordinal and monotonic data. \newline
In the first chapter is introduced the problem of dealing with ordinal and monotonic data, their nature and applications. The second chapter offers a theoretical explanation of the four supervised algorithms developed for classification (SVMOP, KDLOR, POM and WKNN) and the two for preprocessing (one instance selector and one feature selector). The third chapter introduces the Scala programming lenguage, used in the development of that package. Chapter four includes a description of development and installation of the developed package for R, named OCAPIS. Chapter five contains the user guide of the package that will be published along with the package in CRAN. Finally, chapter six includes the results, conclussions and future work for OCAPIS.
