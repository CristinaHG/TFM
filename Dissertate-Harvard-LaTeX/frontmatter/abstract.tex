% the abstract

The present master's final project develop a software package with multiple algorithms for efficiently preprocessing and classifying data with specific intrinsic restrictions due to its nature, as ordinal and monotonic data. \newline
Specifically, four ordinal classification techniques are implemented in Scala: Support Vector Machine for Ordinal Regression, Proportional Odd models, Kernel Discriminant Learning for Ordinal Regression, and Weighted-nearest-neighborgs, along with two preprocessing techniques: one feature selector based in information theory which uses the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance along with Rank Mutual Information, and an instance selector based in three phases which first selects promising features, then removes collisions and finally detects the relevant instances by using delimitation and interest metrics.
